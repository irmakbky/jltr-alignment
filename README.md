# Just Label the Repeats for In-The-Wild Audio-to-Score Alignment

We propose an efficient alignment workflow that leverages a human-in-the-loop approach to perform audio-to-score alignment. This repository contains the code for using this workflow as well as reproducing results from our ISMIR 2024 paper.
